<h1>Create ERC-20 Token with Minimum Cost — No Coding</h1>
 
If you have a project on the Ethereum network and the token creation process seems complicated and expensive to you, you can get rid of the question marks in your mind by reading this article and complete your cheap erc-20 token creation process. You can create erc-20 tokens with “Verified Source Code” in seconds for only 0.01 ETH without any coding knowledge.
			
<h2>
Things to Consider When Creating ERC-2O Token</h2><p>
Although there are many tools titled “Create Cheap ERC-20”, unfortunately, most of these sites have old smart contract software and bring many problems with them. For this reason, you need to make sure that the smart contract you will use is up to date.

</p>

<p>
Another thing you should pay attention to is that the source code must be verifiable. “Verified Source Code” is the biggest proof that your project has a reliable and up-to-date source code.
</p>


<p>
Another important thing to note is that your token project must be “ERC20 Compliant”. This feature allows you to be listed on decentralized exchanges on dex platforms such as (Uniswap). Uniswap and all other dex platforms support the ERC20 standard.

<h2>Additional Features You Can Add to Your Project</h2></p>
<p>Below are some of the features that your token project may need, you don’t need to use all of these features, but you can integrate the features that can benefit you to make your project more feature-rich. Even if you use all of these features, there will be no change in the fee and you will be able to create your token for only 0.01 ETH.</p>
<p><b>ERC20 Compliant:</b> ERC20 Compliance ensures that the tokens created adhere to the ERC20 standard, allowing for seamless integration and compatibility with Ethereum wallets and platforms.</p>
<p><b>Verified Source Code:</b> ERC-20 Verified Source Code is the approved version of the source code for an Ethereum token, ensuring its security and functionality.</p>
<p><b>Burnable:</b> Burnable refers to the capability of a token to be permanently removed from circulation, typically through a predefined mechanism or function within its smart contract.</p>
<p><b>Mintable:</b> Mintable refers to the capability of a token to be created or “minted” after its initial deployment, typically through a predefined mechanism or function within its smart contract.</p>
<p><b>Reflection:</b> Reflection refers to the process by which a token redistributes a portion of transaction fees or rewards to its holders automatically, usually in proportion to their holdings, often implemented through a smart contract mechanism.</p>
<p><b>Taxable:</b> Taxable typically refers to a token that incurs a fee or levy on certain transactions, redistributing the collected fees to designated recipients or purposes, often managed through a smart contract.</p>
<p><b>Anti Whale Protection:</b> Anti-whale protection refers to measures implemented within a token’s smart contract to discourage large holders, or “whales,” from dominating the token’s ecosystem, often by imposing transaction limits or fees that increase with transaction size.</p>
<p><b>Liquidty Pool Setup:</b> Liquidity pool setup involves creating a reserve of assets, typically in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, to facilitate trading by providing liquidity for token pairs. This setup usually involves depositing an equal value of two assets into a pool, enabling users to trade between them efficiently.</p>
